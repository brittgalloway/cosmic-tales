# Cosmic Tales

## Learn about the solar system

Click on a planet to learn about it.

## Why Make This
This was a fun experiment with CSS. I wanted to see how much I could make without any JavaScript. I really like our solar system and thought it would be fun to make a mini solor system with the correct relative speeds. Earth goes around in 1 minute to represent 1 year and all other planets are relative to that. Mercury goes around in 14 seconds, while Pluto takes over 2 hours!

I used a lot of mixins because all the planets are same except for color/texture, size, and postion/speed. 

Because there were only a few variables difference between the planets, I learned a lot about the power of CSS variables and how easily they can applied for more than text color.

Another fascinating discovery was the sass function used to make the stars. Shoutout to [johnbgarcia](https://codepen.io/johnbgarcia/pen/qqdgGp) and [dannyrb](https://codepen.io/dannyrb/pen/ORqvey) for the stars!
I was diterminded to find an all CSS method and there was (at least) 1!

Orignally, I made this with asby because I had big ideas about sharing a story about each planet, or doing more with planetary facts. However, as I got to that part, I found myself becoming bored. 
If I were to keep working on this, I'd improve the "click on a planet aspect". Or omit it entirely and find a way to let a vistor know about the planet speeds if nothing else.
