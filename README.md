# Cosmic Tales

Cosmic Tales is a fun and experimental project in CSS, created with Sass and Gatsby. The aim was to explore the power of CSS and see how much of a mini solar system could be crafted without using any JavaScript. Each planet in the solar system is accurately scaled in relative size and speed.

## Project Overview
### Motivation
The motivation behind Cosmic Tales was a deep appreciation for our solar system. The project was born out of curiosity: "How much of a solar system could I replicate using only CSS?" The challenge was to create a mini solar system where Earth orbits the sun in 1 minute, and all other planets move at relative speeds. For example, Mercury orbits in just 14 seconds, while Pluto takes over 2 hours for one orbit.

### Technology Used
- Sass: The project relies heavily on Sass, utilizing mixins and CSS variables to create and customize each planet's appearance and motion.
- Gatsby: Originally, this project was built with Gatsby, with plans to share stories about each planet or include more planetary facts. However, the focus shifted to the CSS experiment.
## Key Takeaways
- CSS Variables: Cosmic Tales highlights the power of CSS variables. With only a few variable differences between the planets, the project demonstrates how CSS variables can be effectively used for more than just text color.
- Sass Functions: The project features a Sass function to create stars. Thanks to the work of contributors like [johnbgarcia](https://codepen.io/johnbgarcia/pen/qqdgGp) and  [dannyrb](https://codepen.io/dannyrb/pen/ORqvey), an all-CSS method for creating stars was achieved.
- Click Interaction: While the project originally had plans for more interactive features, the focus shifted to the CSS experiment. If further development were to occur, enhancing the "click on a planet" aspect or finding ways to educate visitors about planet speeds could be considered.

Cosmic Tales was an exciting CSS experiment that brings the solar system to life. If you have a passion for astronomy and a fascination with the power of CSS, this project is a testament to what can be achieved with creativity and a bit of code.

Enjoy exploring the mini solar system, and feel free to make improvements or modifications to further enhance the project.
